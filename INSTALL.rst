Installation
============

You can use the `pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ utility to
install this package. One way of doing that is by pointing pip directly to the
directory containing the setup.py file such as::

   pip install .

Alternatively, one can use the public repository of this project for
installation by pip such as::

    pip install git@github.com:crim-ca/ServiceGateway.git

This will install the Service Gateway along with program entry points for
various utilities.

A good practise might be to make use of a `virtual environment
<https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ in which all the
dependencies will be installed through pip.
