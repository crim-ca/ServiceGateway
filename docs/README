To generate the documentation, you need to install all the requirements in
../requirements.pip. A good idea is to do this in a virtual env, source the
activate script such as:
   
   source env/bin/activate.csh

Then, from this directory, issue the command:

   make html

Also you can use the sync program to send the rendered documentation at it's
standard location such as : 

    ./sync.py

Otherwise you can use the install directive with make wich will invoke the
latter : 

   make install
