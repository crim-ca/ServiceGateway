CHAPTER 103 . MAXIMILIAN . VILLEFORT ROSE , HALF ASHAMED OF BEING SURPRISED IN SUCH A PAROXYSM OF GRIEF . THE TERRIBLE OFFICE HE HAD HELD FOR TWENTY - FIVE YEARS HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HIM MORE OR LESS THAN MAN . HIS GLANCE , AT FIRST WANDERING , FIXED ITSELF UPON MORREL . " WHO ARE YOU , SIR , " HE ASKED , " THAT FORGET THAT THIS IS NOT THE MANNER TO ENTER A HOUSE STRICKEN WITH DEATH ? GO , SIR , GO ! " BUT MORREL REMAINED MOTIONLESS ; HE COULD NOT DETACH HIS EYES FROM THAT DISORDERED BED , AND THE PALE CORPSE OF THE YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS LYING ON IT . " GO ! - - DO YOU HEAR ? " SAID VILLEFORT , WHILE D'AVRIGNY ADVANCED TO LEAD MORREL OUT . MAXIMILIAN STARED FOR A MOMENT AT THE CORPSE , GAZED ALL AROUND THE ROOM , THEN UPON THE TWO MEN ; HE OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK , BUT FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE UTTERANCE TO THE INNUMERABLE IDEAS THAT OCCUPIED HIS BRAIN , HE WENT OUT , THRUSTING HIS HANDS THROUGH HIS HAIR IN SUCH A MANNER THAT VILLEFORT AND D'AVRIGNY , FOR A MOMENT DIVERTED FROM THE ENGROSSING TOPIC , EXCHANGED GLANCES , WHICH SEEMED TO SAY , - - " HE IS MAD ! " BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT . MORREL WAS SEEN CARRYING , WITH SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH , THE ARM - CHAIR CONTAINING NOIRTIER UP - STAIRS . WHEN HE REACHED THE LANDING HE PLACED THE ARM - CHAIR ON THE FLOOR AND RAPIDLY ROLLED IT INTO VALENTINE'S ROOM . THIS COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF UNNATURAL STRENGTH SUPPLIED BY POWERFUL EXCITEMENT . BUT THE MOST FEARFUL SPECTACLE WAS NOIRTIER BEING PUSHED TOWARDS THE BED , HIS FACE EXPRESSING ALL HIS MEANING , AND HIS EYES SUPPLYING THE WANT OF EVERY OTHER FACULTY . THAT PALE FACE AND FLAMING GLANCE APPEARED TO VILLEFORT LIKE A FRIGHTFUL APPARITION . EACH TIME HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH HIS FATHER , SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED . " SEE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ! " CRIED MORREL , WITH ONE HAND LEANING ON THE BACK OF THE CHAIR , AND THE OTHER EXTENDED TOWARDS VALENTINE . " SEE , MY FATHER , SEE ! " VILLEFORT DREW BACK AND LOOKED WITH ASTONISHMENT ON THE YOUNG MAN , WHO , ALMOST A STRANGER TO HIM , CALLED NOIRTIER HIS FATHER . AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT ; THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED ; HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE , AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY ; NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY . AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES , IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK - - A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE . D'AVRIGNY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE . " SIR , " CRIED MORREL , SEIZING THE MOIST HAND OF THE PARALYTIC , " THEY ASK ME WHO I AM , AND WHAT RIGHT I HAVE TO BE HERE . OH , YOU KNOW IT , TELL THEM , TELL THEM ! " AND THE YOUNG MAN'S VOICE WAS CHOKED BY SOBS . AS FOR THE OLD MAN , HIS CHEST HEAVED WITH HIS PANTING RESPIRATION . ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS UNDERGOING THE AGONIES PRECEDING DEATH . AT LENGTH , HAPPIER THAN THE YOUNG MAN , WHO SOBBED WITHOUT WEEPING , TEARS GLISTENED IN THE EYES OF NOIRTIER . " TELL THEM , " SAID MORREL IN A HOARSE VOICE , " TELL THEM THAT I AM HER BETROTHED . TELL THEM SHE WAS MY BELOVED , MY NOBLE GIRL , MY ONLY BLESSING IN THE WORLD . TELL THEM - - OH , TELL THEM , THAT CORPSE BELONGS TO ME ! " THE YOUNG MAN OVERWHELMED BY THE WEIGHT OF HIS ANGUISH , FELL HEAVILY ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE BED , WHICH HIS FINGERS GRASPED WITH CONVULSIVE ENERGY . D'AVRIGNY , UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION , TURNED AWAY ; AND VILLEFORT , WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION , AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN , EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN . BUT MORREL SAW NOTHING ; HE HAD GRASPED THE HAND OF VALENTINE , AND UNABLE TO WEEP VENTED HIS AGONY IN GROANS AS HE BIT THE SHEETS . FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS , EXCLAMATIONS , AND PRAYERS . AT LENGTH VILLEFORT , THE MOST COMPOSED OF ALL , SPOKE : " SIR , " SAID HE TO MAXIMILIAN , " YOU SAY YOU LOVED VALENTINE , THAT YOU WERE BETROTHED TO HER . I KNEW NOTHING OF THIS ENGAGEMENT , OF THIS LOVE , YET I , HER FATHER , FORGIVE YOU , FOR I SEE THAT YOUR GRIEF IS REAL AND DEEP ; AND BESIDES MY OWN SORROW IS TOO GREAT FOR ANGER TO FIND A PLACE IN MY HEART . BUT YOU SEE THAT THE ANGEL WHOM YOU HOPED FOR HAS LEFT THIS EARTH - - SHE HAS NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THE ADORATION OF MEN . TAKE A LAST FAREWELL , SIR , OF HER SAD REMAINS ; TAKE THE HAND YOU EXPECTED TO POSSESS ONCE MORE WITHIN YOUR OWN , AND THEN SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM HER FOREVER . VALENTINE NOW REQUIRES ONLY THE MINISTRATIONS OF THE PRIEST . " " YOU ARE MISTAKEN , SIR , " EXCLAIMED MORREL , RAISING HIMSELF ON ONE KNEE , HIS HEART PIERCED BY A MORE ACUTE PANG THAN ANY HE HAD YET FELT - - " YOU ARE MISTAKEN ; VALENTINE , DYING AS SHE HAS , NOT ONLY REQUIRES A PRIEST , BUT AN AVENGER . YOU , M . DE VILLEFORT , SEND FOR THE PRIEST ; I WILL BE THE AVENGER . " " WHAT DO YOU MEAN , SIR ? " ASKED VILLEFORT , TREMBLING AT THE NEW IDEA INSPIRED BY THE DELIRIUM OF MORREL . " I TELL YOU , SIR , THAT TWO PERSONS EXIST IN YOU ; THE FATHER HAS MOURNED SUFFICIENTLY , NOW LET THE PROCUREUR FULFIL HIS OFFICE . " THE EYES OF NOIRTIER GLISTENED , AND D'AVRIGNY APPROACHED . " GENTLEMEN , " SAID MORREL , READING ALL THAT PASSED THROUGH THE MINDS OF THE WITNESSES TO THE SCENE , " I KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING , AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY - - VALENTINE HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED ! " VILLEFORT HUNG HIS HEAD , D'AVRIGNY APPROACHED NEARER , AND NOIRTIER SAID " YES " WITH HIS EYES . " NOW , SIR , " CONTINUED MORREL , " IN THESE DAYS NO ONE CAN DISAPPEAR BY VIOLENT MEANS WITHOUT SOME INQUIRIES BEING MADE AS TO THE CAUSE OF HER DISAPPEARANCE , EVEN WERE SHE NOT A YOUNG , BEAUTIFUL , AND ADORABLE CREATURE LIKE VALENTINE . MR . PROCUREUR , " SAID MORREL WITH INCREASING VEHEMENCE , " NO MERCY IS ALLOWED ; I DENOUNCE THE CRIME ; IT IS YOUR PLACE TO SEEK THE ASSASSIN . " THE YOUNG MAN'S IMPLACABLE EYES INTERROGATED VILLEFORT , WHO , ON HIS SIDE , GLANCED FROM NOIRTIER TO D'AVRIGNY . BUT INSTEAD OF FINDING SYMPATHY IN THE EYES OF THE DOCTOR AND HIS FATHER , HE ONLY SAW AN EXPRESSION AS INFLEXIBLE AS THAT OF MAXIMILIAN . " YES , " INDICATED THE OLD MAN . " ASSUREDLY , " SAID D'AVRIGNY . " SIR , " SAID VILLEFORT , STRIVING TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS TRIPLE FORCE AND HIS OWN EMOTION , - - " SIR , YOU ARE DECEIVED ; NO ONE COMMITS CRIMES HERE . I AM STRICKEN BY FATE . IT IS HORRIBLE , INDEED , BUT NO ONE ASSASSINATES . " THE EYES OF NOIRTIER LIGHTED UP WITH RAGE , AND D'AVRIGNY PREPARED TO SPEAK . MORREL , HOWEVER , EXTENDED HIS ARM , AND COMMANDED SILENCE . " AND I SAY THAT MURDERS ARE COMMITTED HERE , " SAID MORREL , WHOSE VOICE , THOUGH LOWER IN TONE , LOST NONE OF ITS TERRIBLE DISTINCTNESS : " I TELL YOU THAT THIS IS THE FOURTH VICTIM WITHIN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS . I TELL YOU , VALENTINE'S LIFE WAS ATTEMPTED BY POISON FOUR DAYS AGO , THOUGH SHE ESCAPED , OWING TO THE PRECAUTIONS OF M . NOIRTIER . I TELL YOU THAT THE DOSE HAS BEEN DOUBLE , THE POISON CHANGED , AND THAT THIS TIME IT HAS SUCCEEDED . I TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW THESE THINGS AS WELL AS I DO , SINCE THIS GENTLEMAN HAS FOREWARNED YOU , BOTH AS A DOCTOR AND AS A FRIEND . " " OH , YOU RAVE , SIR , " EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT , IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN . " I RAVE ? " SAID MORREL ; " WELL , THEN , I APPEAL TO M . D'AVRIGNY HIMSELF . ASK HIM , SIR , IF HE RECOLLECTS THE WORDS HE UTTERED IN THE GARDEN OF THIS HOUSE ON THE NIGHT OF MADAME DE SAINT - MERAN'S DEATH . YOU THOUGHT YOURSELVES ALONE , AND TALKED ABOUT THAT TRAGICAL DEATH , AND THE FATALITY YOU MENTIONED THEN IS THE SAME WHICH HAS CAUSED THE MURDER OF VALENTINE . " VILLEFORT AND D'AVRIGNY EXCHANGED LOOKS . " YES , YES , " CONTINUED MORREL ; " RECALL THE SCENE , FOR THE WORDS YOU THOUGHT WERE ONLY GIVEN TO SILENCE AND SOLITUDE FELL INTO MY EARS . CERTAINLY , AFTER WITNESSING THE CULPABLE INDOLENCE MANIFESTED BY M . DE VILLEFORT TOWARDS HIS OWN RELATIONS , I OUGHT TO HAVE DENOUNCED HIM TO THE AUTHORITIES ; THEN I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN ACCOMPLICE TO THY DEATH , AS I NOW AM , SWEET , BELOVED VALENTINE ; BUT THE ACCOMPLICE SHALL BECOME THE AVENGER . THIS FOURTH MURDER IS APPARENT TO ALL , AND IF THY FATHER ABANDON THEE , VALENTINE , IT IS I , AND I SWEAR IT , THAT SHALL PURSUE THE ASSASSIN . " AND THIS TIME , AS THOUGH NATURE HAD AT LEAST TAKEN COMPASSION ON THE VIGOROUS FRAME , NEARLY BURSTING WITH ITS OWN STRENGTH , THE WORDS OF MORREL WERE STIFLED IN HIS THROAT ; HIS BREAST HEAVED ; THE TEARS , SO LONG REBELLIOUS , GUSHED FROM HIS EYES ; AND HE THREW HIMSELF WEEPING ON HIS KNEES BY THE SIDE OF THE BED . THEN D'AVRIGNY SPOKE . " AND I , TOO , " HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOW VOICE , " I UNITE WITH M . MORREL IN DEMANDING JUSTICE FOR CRIME ; MY BLOOD BOILS AT THE IDEA OF HAVING ENCOURAGED A MURDERER BY MY COWARDLY CONCESSION . " " OH , MERCIFUL HEAVENS ! " MURMURED VILLEFORT . MORREL RAISED HIS HEAD , AND READING THE EYES OF THE OLD MAN , WHICH GLEAMED WITH UNNATURAL LUSTRE , - - " STAY , " HE SAID , " M . NOIRTIER WISHES TO SPEAK . " " YES , " INDICATED NOIRTIER , WITH AN EXPRESSION THE MORE TERRIBLE , FROM ALL HIS FACULTIES BEING CENTRED IN HIS GLANCE . " DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ? " ASKED MORREL . " YES , " REPLIED NOIRTIER . " AND WILL YOU DIRECT US ? " EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG MAN . " LISTEN , M . D'AVRIGNY , LISTEN ! " NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY , AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION . THEN , HAVING RIVETED THE EYES OF HIS INTERLOCUTOR ON HIS OWN , HE GLANCED TOWARDS THE DOOR . " DO YOU WISH ME TO LEAVE ? " SAID MORREL , SADLY . " YES , " REPLIED NOIRTIER . " ALAS , ALAS , SIR , HAVE PITY ON ME ! " THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOOR . " MAY I , AT LEAST , RETURN ? " ASKED MORREL . " YES . " " MUST I LEAVE ALONE ? " " NO . " " WHOM AM I TO TAKE WITH ME ? THE PROCUREUR ? " " NO . " " THE DOCTOR ? " " YES . " " YOU WISH TO REMAIN ALONE WITH M . DE VILLEFORT ? " " YES . " " BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU ? " " YES . " " OH , " SAID VILLEFORT , INEXPRESSIBLY DELIGHTED TO THINK THAT THE INQUIRIES WERE TO BE MADE BY HIM ALONE , - - " OH , BE SATISFIED , I CAN UNDERSTAND MY FATHER . " D'AVRIGNY TOOK THE YOUNG MAN'S ARM , AND LED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM . A MORE THAN DEATHLIKE SILENCE THEN REIGNED IN THE HOUSE . AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR A FALTERING FOOTSTEP WAS HEARD , AND VILLEFORT APPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT WHERE D'AVRIGNY AND MORREL HAD BEEN STAYING , ONE ABSORBED IN MEDITATION , THE OTHER IN GRIEF . " YOU CAN COME , " HE SAID , AND LED THEM BACK TO NOIRTIER . MORREL LOOKED ATTENTIVELY ON VILLEFORT . HIS FACE WAS LIVID , LARGE DROPS ROLLED DOWN HIS FACE , AND IN HIS FINGERS HE HELD THE FRAGMENTS OF A QUILL PEN WHICH HE HAD TORN TO ATOMS . " GENTLEMEN , " HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE , " GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES ! " THE TWO MEN DREW BACK . " I ENTREAT YOU . " - - CONTINUED VILLEFORT . " BUT , " SAID MORREL , " THE CULPRIT - - THE MURDERER - - THE ASSASSIN . " " DO NOT ALARM YOURSELF , SIR ; JUSTICE WILL BE DONE , " SAID VILLEFORT . " MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME ; MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO , YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET . DO YOU NOT , FATHER ? " " YES , " RESOLUTELY REPLIED NOIRTIER . MORREL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM . " OH , SIR , " SAID VILLEFORT , ARRESTING MAXIMILIAN BY THE ARM , " IF MY FATHER , THE INFLEXIBLE MAN , MAKES THIS REQUEST , IT IS BECAUSE HE KNOWS , BE ASSURED , THAT VALENTINE WILL BE TERRIBLY REVENGED . IS IT NOT SO , FATHER ? " THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE . VILLEFORT CONTINUED : " HE KNOWS ME , AND I HAVE PLEDGED MY WORD TO HIM . REST ASSURED , GENTLEMEN , THAT WITHIN THREE DAYS , IN A LESS TIME THAN JUSTICE WOULD DEMAND , THE REVENGE I SHALL HAVE TAKEN FOR THE MURDER OF MY CHILD WILL BE SUCH AS TO MAKE THE BOLDEST HEART TREMBLE ; " AND AS HE SPOKE THESE WORDS HE GROUND HIS TEETH , AND GRASPED THE OLD MAN'S SENSELESS HAND . " WILL THIS PROMISE BE FULFILLED , M . NOIRTIER ? " ASKED MORREL , WHILE D'AVRIGNY LOOKED INQUIRINGLY . " YES , " REPLIED NOIRTIER WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SINISTER JOY . " SWEAR , THEN , " SAID VILLEFORT , JOINING THE HANDS OF MORREL AND D'AVRIGNY , " SWEAR THAT YOU WILL SPARE THE HONOR OF MY HOUSE , AND LEAVE ME TO AVENGE MY CHILD . " D'AVRIGNY TURNED ROUND AND UTTERED A VERY FEEBLE " YES , " BUT MORREL , DISENGAGING HIS HAND , RUSHED TO THE BED , AND AFTER HAVING PRESSED THE COLD LIPS OF VALENTINE WITH HIS OWN , HURRIEDLY LEFT , UTTERING A LONG , DEEP GROAN OF DESPAIR AND ANGUISH . WE HAVE BEFORE STATED THAT ALL THE SERVANTS HAD FLED . M . DE VILLEFORT WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO REQUEST M . D'AVRIGNY TO SUPERINTEND ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS CONSEQUENT UPON A DEATH IN A LARGE CITY , MORE ESPECIALLY A DEATH UNDER SUCH SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES . IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY , THE MUTE DESPAIR OF NOIRTIER , WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS . VILLEFORT RETIRED TO HIS STUDY , AND D'AVRIGNY LEFT TO SUMMON THE DOCTOR OF THE MAYORALTY , WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO EXAMINE BODIES AFTER DECEASE , AND WHO IS EXPRESSLY NAMED " THE DOCTOR OF THE DEAD . " M . NOIRTIER COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO QUIT HIS GRANDCHILD . AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR M . D'AVRIGNY RETURNED WITH HIS ASSOCIATE ; THEY FOUND THE OUTER GATE CLOSED , AND NOT A SERVANT REMAINING IN THE HOUSE ; VILLEFORT HIMSELF WAS OBLIGED TO OPEN TO THEM . BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING ; HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER . THE TWO DOCTORS , THEREFORE , ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE . NOIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED , PALE , MOTIONLESS , AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE . THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD ; HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE , AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS . " ALAS , " SAID D'AVRIGNY , " SHE IS INDEED DEAD , POOR CHILD ! " " YES , " ANSWERED THE DOCTOR LACONICALLY , DROPPING THE SHEET HE HAD RAISED . NOIRTIER UTTERED A KIND OF HOARSE , RATTLING SOUND ; THE OLD MAN'S EYES SPARKLED , AND THE GOOD DOCTOR UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WISHED TO BEHOLD HIS CHILD . HE THEREFORE APPROACHED THE BED , AND WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS DIPPING THE FINGERS WITH WHICH HE HAD TOUCHED THE LIPS OF THE CORPSE IN CHLORIDE OF LIME , HE UNCOVERED THE CALM AND PALE FACE , WHICH LOOKED LIKE THAT OF A SLEEPING ANGEL . A TEAR , WHICH APPEARED IN THE OLD MAN'S EYE , EXPRESSED HIS THANKS TO THE DOCTOR . THE DOCTOR OF THE DEAD THEN LAID HIS PERMIT ON THE CORNER OF THE TABLE , AND HAVING FULFILLED HIS DUTY , WAS CONDUCTED OUT BY D'AVRIGNY . VILLEFORT MET THEM AT THE DOOR OF HIS STUDY ; HAVING IN A FEW WORDS THANKED THE DISTRICT DOCTOR , HE TURNED TO D'AVRIGNY , AND SAID , - - " AND NOW THE PRIEST . " " IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR PRIEST YOU WISH TO PRAY WITH VALENTINE ? " ASKED D'AVRIGNY . " NO . " SAID VILLEFORT ; " FETCH THE NEAREST . " " THE NEAREST , " SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR , " IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE , WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU . SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS ? " " D'AVRIGNY , " SAID VILLEFORT , " BE SO KIND , I BESEECH YOU , AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN . HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR , SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE ; YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU , AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM . " " DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM ? " " I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE . YOU WILL EXCUSE ME , WILL YOU NOT ? A PRIEST CAN UNDERSTAND A FATHER'S GRIEF . " AND M . DE VILLEFORT , GIVING THE KEY TO D'AVRIGNY , AGAIN BADE FAREWELL TO THE STRANGE DOCTOR , AND RETIRED TO HIS STUDY , WHERE HE BEGAN TO WORK . FOR SOME TEMPERAMENTS WORK IS A REMEDY FOR ALL AFFLICTIONS . AS THE DOCTORS ENTERED THE STREET , THEY SAW A MAN IN A CASSOCK STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE NEXT DOOR . " THIS IS THE ABBE OF WHOM I SPOKE , " SAID THE DOCTOR TO D'AVRIGNY . D'AVRIGNY ACCOSTED THE PRIEST . " SIR , " HE SAID , " ARE YOU DISPOSED TO CONFER A GREAT OBLIGATION ON AN UNHAPPY FATHER WHO HAS JUST LOST HIS DAUGHTER ? I MEAN M . DE VILLEFORT , THE KING'S ATTORNEY . " " AH , " SAID THE PRIEST , IN A MARKED ITALIAN ACCENT ; " YES , I HAVE HEARD THAT DEATH IS IN THAT HOUSE . " " THEN I NEED NOT TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF SERVICE HE REQUIRES OF YOU . " " I WAS ABOUT TO OFFER MYSELF , SIR , " SAID THE PRIEST ; " IT IS OUR MISSION TO FORESTALL OUR DUTIES . " " IT IS A YOUNG GIRL . " " I KNOW IT , SIR ; THE SERVANTS WHO FLED FROM THE HOUSE INFORMED ME . I ALSO KNOW THAT HER NAME IS VALENTINE , AND I HAVE ALREADY PRAYED FOR HER . " " THANK YOU , SIR , " SAID D'AVRIGNY ; " SINCE YOU HAVE COMMENCED YOUR SACRED OFFICE , DEIGN TO CONTINUE IT . COME AND WATCH BY THE DEAD , AND ALL THE WRETCHED FAMILY WILL BE GRATEFUL TO YOU . " " I AM GOING , SIR ; AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE . " D'AVRIGNY TOOK THE PRIEST'S HAND , AND WITHOUT MEETING VILLEFORT , WHO WAS ENGAGED IN HIS STUDY , THEY REACHED VALENTINE'S ROOM , WHICH ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WAS TO BE OCCUPIED BY THE UNDERTAKERS . ON ENTERING THE ROOM , NOIRTIER'S EYES MET THOSE OF THE ABBE , AND NO DOUBT HE READ SOME PARTICULAR EXPRESSION IN THEM , FOR HE REMAINED IN THE ROOM . D'AVRIGNY RECOMMENDED THE ATTENTION OF THE PRIEST TO THE LIVING AS WELL AS TO THE DEAD , AND THE ABBE PROMISED TO DEVOTE HIS PRAYERS TO VALENTINE AND HIS ATTENTIONS TO NOIRTIER . IN ORDER , DOUBTLESS , THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE DISTURBED WHILE FULFILLING HIS SACRED MISSION , THE PRIEST ROSE AS SOON AS D'AVRIGNY DEPARTED , AND NOT ONLY BOLTED THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE DOCTOR HAD JUST LEFT , BUT ALSO THAT LEADING TO MADAME DE VILLEFORT'S ROOM .
